dcc (1.3.42-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Drop dcc-client, merge it into dcc-server (see NEWS.Debian).

  * debian/dcc-common.preinst:
    + remove legacy upgrades (from woody ?).
    + rename /etc/default/dcc-server into /etc/default/dcc-common

  * Simplify postinst scripts:
    + avoid conditionnal chowns/chmods where we can force them.
    + move /var/{run,log}/dcc existence into the package, just chown them.
    + use a more robust way to generate random strings, involving /dev/urandom
      rather than ps.

  * Update /etc/default/dcc-commmon from upstream one.

  * Update debian example whitelist.

  * Simplify update-dccmaps.

  * Remove DH_VERBOSE set to 1, renders the output unreadable, for few
    important information anyway.

  * fix dblist.8 man page (add the missing 8 section in .Dt)

  * Init scripts:
    + install upstream start-* and stop-dccd into /usr/lib/dcc.
    + completely rework init scripts to use upstream ways to start daemons. It
      does not ignore the configuration anymore.

  * This upload fixes numerous packaging problems including:
    + daemons are not enabled by default, one need to explicitely activate
      them in /etc/dcc/dcc_conf (Closes: 320943).
    + permissions were not always enforced on /var/lib/dcc/map in the postinst
      (Closes: 365892).
    + Using upstream scripts makes us read dcc_conf for dccifd as well
      (Closes: 353446).

    (`chown dcc.dcc' was quietly fixed in 1.2.74-3.)

dcc (1.2.62-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    Changes form Upstream regarding Linux:
    + Fix file descriptor leak in getifaddrs() replacement.
    + Extended format to allow authenticated clients to be delayed
      as `dccd -U` delays anonymous clients in /var/lib/dcc/ids
    + Possibility to limit the size of the database window.
    + Fixed broken `dccd -G0`.
    + Track changes in network interfaces on most modern flavors of UNIX.
    + Fix two MIME decoding bugs.
    + Treat '>' as a blank instead of punctuation for FUZ2 checksums.
    + Don't re-use va_list in stdargs functions to work around a
      characteristic of gcc for AMD 64 bit systems.  gcc 64-bit stdargs
      reportedly passes va_list by reference instead of by value.
  * Dan Weber is no longer maintainer.
  * My own patches reside now in debian/patches rather than in diff.gz
  * Added symlink from /etc/default/dcc-server to /var/lib/dcc/dcc_conf

    them. (closes: #276259)
  * Package should be in better state now. (closes:#278048)
