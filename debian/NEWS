dcc (1.3.42-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * dcc-client is gone, and merged into dcc-server. The space gained by the
    split was very small, and resulted in an overcomplicated packaging.

  * in that release, init scripts have been reworked a *lot* and now use
    upstreams scripts correctly. You may have needed to handcraft it
    previously, it's no more needed.

  * /etc/default/dcc-server has been renamed into /etc/default/dcc-common. An
    attempt to move that file if it exists is done.

    Also note that OPTIONS in /etc/default/dcc-common is obsolete and not used
    anymore. use the appropriates DCC*_ARGS instead.
